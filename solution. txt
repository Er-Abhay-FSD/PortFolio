1. Question 1

Given a binary number as a string, x(a binary string), return the binary string of the same length, y, that will produce the maximum value when XORed with x. There is a number of bits that may be set in y called maxSet.

Example

b / t * s = 3

maxset = 1 x = 101

The binary strings will always have bits digits, and leading zeros are fine.

1. First, determine all possible bits = 3 digit binary strings with only maxBits = 1 or fewer bits set: 000,001,010, 100. These are the potential y values.

2. Now, XOR each of the y values with x = 10

1.000 xor 101 = 101

2.001 xor 101 = 100

3. 010 xor 101 = 111

4. 100 xor 101 = 1

The third value produces the maximal result, where y = 10 Return the string '010'.

Function Description

Complete the function findValue in the editor below.

findYValue has the following parameter(s):

int bits: the length of the binary strings x and y

int maxSet: the number of bits that may be set in y

string x: a binary string

Returns

string: the best y value as a binary string
